## Convention

Following a typical Next.js + shadcn/ui project:
* All generic UI components are placed in `/components/ui`.
  Specialized UI components are placed alongside `page.tsx` in each route folder.
* All reusable utility functions are placed in `/lib`.
* All public assets, except for `favicon.ico` and `opengraph-image.jpg`, are placed inside `/public`.
* All scripts are placed in `/scripts`.
